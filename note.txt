HOST REACTPRESS:
- npm run build the project
- then access to the folder /home/careerf/public_html/wp-content/reactpress/apps/ by plugin WP File Manager
- remove the old project folder, then reupload the updated folder
- then use ReactPress to choose host destination of the folder
- note: 
    - but we can set the destination to only / or the main adress
    - we only set it to /abcxyz 
    - so we need to tool/Redirection (Redirection plugin) to setup automatically redirect to the address of the project when we access /
